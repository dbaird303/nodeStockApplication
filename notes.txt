npm install -D nodemon
    This installs nodemon aka NodeMonitor which allows you to no have to 
    exit the server every time you make a change. The -D means it is only 
    running on the Development side of the application. You then add a script in the package.json
    file like this: "start": "node index", "dev" : "nodemon index". You use the command
    npm run dev. "run" allows you to execute whatever scripts you add in the package.json file.

Remember, websites are just an organization of files. Big or small.

Handlebars is a JS library used to create reusable webpage templates. It makes it a lot easier
to work with dynamic webpages. You can easily pass info/variables/data from backend and display
it to the front end. A little confusing at first, but not too hard.

Version Control
    Very important for all coding. Allows you to save versions of your code. Over time it will
    take snapshots of your code and save them. Great for working with teams.
